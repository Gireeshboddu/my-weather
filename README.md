Automated Forecasting System using Airflow and Machine Learning (Random Forest Regressor)
Weather forecasting is a cornerstone of modern planning and decision-making across numerous sectorsâ€”including agriculture, logistics, energy, construction, public safety, and disaster preparedness. Accurate short-term forecasts can help optimize irrigation schedules, reduce flight delays, prevent crop damage, and enable emergency services to act preemptively in the face of severe weather conditions. As climate variability increases, the importance of timely and localized weather predictions has grown more significant than ever before.
Traditionally, weather data is sourced from national agencies or third-party services, but making this data usable for real-time decision-making often requires extensive manual handling, transformation, and analysis. This becomes increasingly inefficient and error-prone as the volume and frequency of data grow. Therefore, developing a robust and automated system for continuously collecting, processing, forecasting, and visualizing weather information becomes essential.
This project introduces a fully automated ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that bridges raw weather data and actionable insights. Using the Weather API as a data source, Apache Airflow for scheduling, and AWS S3 for cloud storage, the system fetches hourly weather data, applies machine learning (Random Forest Regression) to forecast temperature for the next hour, and visualizes both actual and predicted metrics through dynamic graphs. The entire workflow is orchestrated via Docker containers, ensuring reproducibility, modularity, and ease of deployment.
By leveraging automation and cloud integration, the project eliminates the need for manual data intervention, ensuring the forecasts are generated on time, with minimal delay. This enables timely responses in smart systems like automated HVAC control, agricultural monitoring platforms, or public dashboards. Beyond technical implementation, this project serves as a real-world demonstration of data engineering, machine learning integration, and cloud-native architecture working cohesively to solve practical forecasting problems.
